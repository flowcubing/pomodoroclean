                The first line of code for this website was written in late May of 2020. Since then, countless hours have been spent trying to complete it. 
                As of June 21st 2020, it is by no means perfect. In fact, most of the website's features don't exist yet. The reason for this has to do with 
                the constant new ideas that I want to implement. Initially, I was dissapointed by all of the poorly designed stopwatches on the internet and I planned to create 
                a good-looking timer (hence the name, Pomodoro Clean) that I would use for tracking pomodoros but it evolved into so much more. This is also why there is a plus 
                on the Pomodoro Clean Logo, meaning that ic ould do MORE than just a timer. With everything that is needed to be added, it's going to take a while before it 
                looks like a proper website. But already, it has greatly helped with staying organized and I use it everyday. Meanwhile, the site is improving and I am excited 
                about its growth. The best support anyone can give us right now is using the feedback form. A new perspective on any part of the website is always appreciated. 
                For updates and progress, the GitHub repository for the website is <a href="https://github.com/flowcubing/pomodoroclean">here.</a> More to come soon!

                <p>
                    Hello! I am a beginner programmer who makes websites to help me and other people in the real world.
                    For example, I make tools that help me improve as a speedcuber, someone who tries to solve the Rubik's cube as fast as possible.
                    I'm also planning on making websites that develop my other hobbies, like piano and soccer.
                    Currently, I have an email an Instagram, which are linked below and are the best ways to contact me.
                    I always appreciate feedback, especially for someone who is just starting out. Thanks for coming to my page.
                </p>
